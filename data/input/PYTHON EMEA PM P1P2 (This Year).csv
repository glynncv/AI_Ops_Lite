           A1: This was due to the SI perimeter server being inactive and unresponsive to the Sterling Integrator.
           Why 2: Why were SI perimeter servers inactive and unresponsive to the SI?
                  A2: It seemed that the SI perimeter server was not functioning properly in the backend, despite the logs appearing
                         normal upon review.
                        Why 3: Why were the SI parameter servers not functioning properly in the backend?
                               A3: To identify the cause, an IBM PMR was raised, and the IBM team made changes to the hostname of the

Final Root Cause: 
There appeared to be an intermittent issue with the SI perimeter server, where certain configurations were stuck. Refreshing the properties ultimately resolved the issue.

- Cisco TAC suggested to perform software upgrade and reboot Core switch (1 hr maintenance window) which was also not agreed considering 24/7 Operational site.
- During Cisco Call, FAN Liu suggested option to configure DHCP Scope on Distribution/Access Switch.
