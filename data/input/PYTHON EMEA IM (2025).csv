The problem is affecting multiple devices and continues to generate new incident tickets (e.g., INC7621283), indicating that it is systemic rather than isolated.

This requires immediate escalation because SAP is a business-critical application used daily by many employees. The recurring installation loop disrupts operations, causes productivity loss, and increases support workload. A permanent fix or clear remediation plan is urgently needed to prevent further impact.","2025-10-30 06:32:03","Waiting For Customer Response","Autoclosed","","false","Web Request","","Error Message","TCKLTOFF00001","2025-11-17 10:00:51","false","Cannot","Warsaw","Poland","Skrzypczynski, Jacob","Wojcik, Rafal","EMEA","Warsaw - Poland"

The user, Esra Baris (Customer Support Engineer, Düsseldorf), has been unable to access a critical shared folder under ""Denilift"" since the morning of 2 June 2025. This folder contains all customer-related documents, and the inability to access it has rendered the user unable to perform essential duties for over 48 hours.

Despite multiple reassignments and updates, the issue persists. The latest findings indicate the server is awaiting a BitLocker PIN to unlock the drive. Guillaume Gauthier has advised that the AD team may be able to retrieve the recovery key from Delphidrive.

Immediate actions requested:

- Confirm whether the BitLocker recovery key has been retrieved and applied.
- Provide a clear update on the current status and next steps.
- Assign a qualified engineer to remotely assist the user if not already done.
- Reassess the priority of this incident given the business-critical impact.

Please treat this with the urgency it demands. The user has expressed significant frustration due to the lack of resolution and expects direct contact and resolution first thing tomorrow.","2025-06-03 16:57:24","Awaiting Resolver Response","Autoclosed","","false","Web Request","","Access/Lockout","","2025-06-18 13:00:41","false","Could","Dusseldorf","Germany","Skrzypczynski, Jacob","S K, Arif","EMEA","Duesseldorf - Germany"

The last recorded activity on the ticket was on April 14th with the status ""Awaiting user response."" Since then, no further progress has been made, and the issue remains unresolved.
Given the impact on daily operations, I expect:
- Immediate analysis of the root cause,

- A proposed action plan with timelines for resolution.
Please prioritize this matter urgently and provide a comprehensive update as soon as possible.

- 3+ days without resolution
- Assigned to Borman Bravo in Global Network Services but minimal progress
- Only one minute of documented work on ticket despite business escalations
- Multiple business stakeholders escalating via email (Export Manager, Logistics Manager)
- P3 SLA for response time (30 minutes) breached by over 5,498%
- No proactive updates provided to affected users

PRIORITY ELEVATION JUSTIFICATION:
- Business leadership (Richard Travers, Logistics Manager) has explicitly stated P3 is unacceptable
- This is a key shipping function critical for export operations during end of quarter
- While a workaround exists (remote work), it's operationally inefficient
- Per Travers: ""without access to this site we cannot ship to our export customers""
- Issue impacting business continuity for export operations


REQUIRED:
1. Recommend immediate elevation to P2
2. Schedule bridge ASAP  today whether P3 or P2
3. Regular status updates (minimum every 4 hours) until resolution
4. Escalation if not resolved within 24 hours

Please acknowledge receipt of this escalation and provide action plan by EOD.","2025-03-28 05:52:55","","Autoclosed","","false","Web Request","","Functionality Error","WARLTOFF00025","2025-04-14 13:00:23","false","Cannot","Warwick","United Kingdom","Skrzypczynski, Jacob","Proyer, Damon","EMEA","Warwick - United Kingdom"

- 32+ days without resolution (opened February 13, 2025)
- Incident currently On Hold with status ""Attempting to reach End User""
- Support team indicates physical user presence required for reinstallation
- Significant discrepancy between ticket documentation and actual requirements

NX Installation Requirements Clarification:
- Current ticket documentation does not specify whether installation is remote or on-site
- ""On Hold"" reason states ""Attempting to reach End User"" suggesting communication issue
- No notes explaining why physical presence is required for NX reinstallation
- Multiple work notes about scheduling meetings without specifying if on-site presence needed
- No documentation if this on-site requirement applies to all NX installations

REQUIRED:
1. Document specific technical reason why NX reinstallation requires user to be onsite if this is non-standard.
2. Confirm user awareness of on-site requirement and obtain scheduling commitment
3. Urgently assess and document business impact:
   * Evaluate if user is unable to perform critical job functions without NX
   * Determine if workarounds exist or temporary solutions are in place
   * Identify if this affects deadlines or deliverables for product development
4. Establish firm resolution deadline with all stakeholders

Please update ticket by EOD with clarified requirements, business impact assessment, and resolution timeline.","2025-03-17 06:30:35","Attempting to reach End User","Autoclosed","","false","Web Request","","Functionality Error","NX Documentation NX11","2025-04-02 17:11:03","false","Cannot","Krakow","Poland","Jaczynski, Piotr","Wojcik, Rafal","EMEA","Krakow - Poland"

JUSTIFICATION FOR PROBLEM RECORD:
- User has confirmed they can connect using IP address (effective workaround)
- Issue is systemic to Zscaler VPN DNS resolution configuration
- Potential impact to multiple users across the organization 
- Requires permanent resolution to prevent recurring incidents

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Close incident with detailed resolution notes documenting workaround
2. Create Problem Record owned by Global Network Services
3. Implement proactive communication to affected user groups
4. Update knowledge base with workaround for similar future issues
5. Establish regular review cycle for the Problem Record until resolved

- Related to approved Change CHG0527044 (approved 06/02/2025)
- Change implemented on 17/01/2025 causing production issues for 33+ days
- Enhancement ZLVEDFF0F_TAX affecting tax data presentation in IDOCs
- Critical business processes impacted due to inconsistent IDOC formatting
- Multiple teams involved without clear resolution path

TECHNICAL CONTEXT:
- A promotion on 17/01/2025 enabled enhancement ZLVEDFF0F_TAX in program LVEDFF0F
- Enhancement code: e1edp04-ktext = ikomv-kschl
- Previously, user exit ZSD_TAXCODE_TXT populated ktext field
- Issue evident in example IDOCs (77587743 showing only ""MWST"" vs. correctly formatted 77587739)
- Technical testing has identified sales document type differences:
  * Failure case: Sales doc type ZCRA (60132643/8248000280/75202201)
  * Success case: Sales doc type ZSTA (2874334/8247001522/75202974)

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Senior ABAP technical resource to evaluate the enhancement impact
2. Change Management to review CHG0527044 and assess if proper testing was performed
3. Investigate why enhancement behaves differently for different sales document types
4. Develop solution (potentially a back-out of the change or a fix-forward approach)
5. Consider implementing back-out plan documented in CHG0527044 if resolution timeline exceeds 48 hours
6. Provide user with comprehensive explanation of technical findings and remediation plan

Please schedule joint Change Management and Technical team meeting by EOD today and provide action plan by tomorrow morning.","2025-02-26 04:10:32","Awaiting On-Site/Local Response","Autoclosed","","false","Web Request","","Error Message","Finance & Controlling PH1","2025-03-12 17:03:01","false","Cannot","Warwick","United Kingdom","Skrzypczynski, Jacob","Proyer, Damon","EMEA","Warwick - United Kingdom"

End user comment: I can log-on with current password on most occasions, sometimes it takes a couple of attempts with time delay in between.
I cannot change my password or log-in to apps (OMS) with my current password.  It seems there is a mismatch somewhere b/w old and new password.
